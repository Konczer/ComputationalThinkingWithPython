# Session 2: Tools, Resources & Complexity

## Online Resources

### Google Colab

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - A free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud and stores notebooks on Google Drive.
Great for projects which does not require a lot of data and computational resources.
- Useful example notebooks:
   - [Markdown guide](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb) - A guide to using Markdown in Colab notebooks.
   - [Overview of Colaboratory Features](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) - An overview of the features available in Colab.
   - [External data: Local Files, Drive, Sheets, and Cloud Storage](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb) - A guide to using external data sources in Colab.
        - It seams that you need to give permission for all categories of data sources to use the IO methods shown in the notebook.
        - Default file write example `foo.txt` will appear in our "My Drive" folder in Google Drive.
    - [Gemini Snippets](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gemini_snippets.ipynb) - A guide to using Gemini snippets in Colab.
       - You will need to generata an API key in Google AI Studio and set it in the notebook "Secrets".

    - []
        - You might register the Google Earrth Engine project
        - You need to change 'my-project' in `ee.Initialize(project='my-project')` to your 'Project ID' for the Google EE project (accessible at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/))
