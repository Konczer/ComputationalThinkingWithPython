# Session 1: Getting Started

## What is Computational Thinking?

In this seminar, by *computational thinking* we mean a structured thinking and general problem solving process. (Which almost always involves some kind of computation, but the focus is on the sincire addressing of the problem and the honest interpretation of the results.)

For the model making processes we will usually use following [4 main steps](https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.computerbasedmath.org/solution-helix-poster/cbm-helix-of-maths-poster-uk.pdf):

- Definition of the problem and asking relevant questions,
- Abstraction of the questions into computable format,
- Computation on data resulting various plots, charts, quantities, and finally,
- Interpret the results and see how well we addressed the original questions and how could we go further.

### Alternatives to computational thinking

Computational thinking is not "the only game in town" i.e. there are many other ways to think, set goals and address problems. Problem solving and navigating life is more of an Art then a systemizable process. However to mention a few alternatives to computational thinking see the following incomplete list:

- [Design Thinking](https://designthinkingmeite.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/22337/2020/02/Tim-Brown-Design-Thinking.pdf)
    - Usually a user/human centered itarative and collaborative process, gauging empathy to understand the needs and preferences of the users.
    - An essential part of any product or application development process.  
- [Systems Thinking](https://research.fit.edu/media/site-specific/researchfitedu/coast-climate-adaptation-library/climate-communications/psychology-amp-behavior/Meadows-2008.-Thinking-in-Systems.pdf)
    - A holistic approach focusing on the emergent properties of a system, which might be hard to compute precisely but some overall behaviour might be inferred.
    - It is often used in the context of complex systems, such as ecosystems, economies, and social systems.
- [Lateral Thinking](https://archive.org/details/seriouscreativity1992ocrgood/Serious-Creativity-1992-Ocr-Good/)
    - Creativity and unconventional approaches: Encourages shifting perspectives, defying logical constraints, and suspending assumptions.
    - An intuitive approach can suite well for choosing a problem and setting a – personal – goal.

(Here I will not mention Critical Thinking and Creative Thinking as alternatives because they are integrated in the flawour of Computational Thinking we will use in this seminar.)

However addressing real world problems is fundamentally an Art, and dogmatic systems are usually too rigid to address them adequately. The listed systemized approaches can be viewed as a set of tools which might be useful in some cases.

## Plan of the seminar

In the first sessions will be about computational and programming tools which can be used to complete the Final Project:
- Elements of the Open Source Software ecosystem:
    - GitHub, Git,
    - Python, virtual environments, IDEs
    - Jupyter notebooks
    - Google Colab
- Online coding and learning platforms 
    - LeetCode, 
    - W3Schools, 
    - Wolfram blogs (for project ideas and inspiration)
- Generative AI tools
    - ChatGPT, 
    - Claude, 
    - Gemini, 
    - GitHub Copilot

### Final Project

An essential and non-trivial part of the seminar is choosing a Final Project topic. Students have the freedom to propose their own projects based on their interests skills and future plans.

The final project has to contain at least one iteration of the listed four steps of the Computational Thinking process, containing:
- A clear description of the addressed problem,
- data collection and/or generation,
- computation and/or data analysis,
- and an honest interpretation of the results.

The Final Project will be a *Computational Essay* (preferably in a Jupyter notebook), accessible publicly on GitHub and/or Google Colab.
The best projects will be offered to develop to a technical blogpost and hopefully published in an online journal/blog series.

### Three Computational Essays

The second half of the seminar will be dedicated to give a menu containing various topics which can be addressed by computational thinking and show examples for Computational Essays.

The chosen topics will be:
- Mathematics & Synthetic data
    - Mathematical modelling, Monte Carlo integration
- Physical chemistry & modelling Real Data
    - Data modelling, linear and nonlinear fitting
- Computational Poetry & ML Basics
    - Machine learning, author guessing "AI"

### Final Project Presentations

The last session will be dedicated to the Final Project presentations. The students will present their projects in a 5-10 minutes long presentation. Peers and the seminar leader will review the projects and the best ones will be selected for further development and publication.
